" Todd and Gina didn’t expect to have to close the dog door, so they pressed the button on the remote only once: to let Fido out. Even worse, in this case, the way they used the door created new problems. Rats and rabbits started coming into their house through the open door, and you’re taking the blame. Let’s tackle Todd and Gina’s dog door again, but this time, we’ll do things a little bit differently. Here’s our plan:
1 - Gather requirements for the dog door.
2 - Figure out what the door should really do.
3 - Get any additional information we need from Todd and Gina. 
4 - Build the door RIGHT!

"A requirement is usually a single thing, and you can test that thing to make sure you’ve actually fulfilled the requirement.
//////////////////////
“system” is the complete app or project you’re working on. In this case, your system is Todd and Gina’s complete dog door setup (which includes the remote control, by the way).
////////////////////
The dog door system has to “do” lots of things: open, close, let Fido out, keep rodents from getting inside... anything that Todd and Gina come up with is part of what the system “does.”
///////////////////
Remember, the customer decides when a system works correctly. So if you leave out a requirement, or even if they forget to mention something to you, the system isn’t working correctly!

requirement. A requirement is a singular need detailing what a particular product or service should be or do. It is most commonly used in a formal sense in systems engineering or software engineering.

"When it comes to requirements, the best thing you can do is let the customer talk. And pay attention to what the system needs to do; you can figure out how the system will do those things later.

Fido’s about a foot tall, and we don’t want him having to hurt his back leaning over to get out the door.  ---> Here’s what Todd and Gina say; it’s your job to translate this into requirements for their door.

"Be sure to leave extra space... additional requirements almost always come up as you work on a project."

"You’ve figured out one of the hardest parts about getting a customer’s requirements—sometimes even the customer doesn’t know what they really want! So you’ve got to ask the customer questions to figure out what they want  before you can determine exactly what the system should do. Then, you can begin to think beyond what your customers asked for and anticipate their needs, even before they realize they have a problem."
